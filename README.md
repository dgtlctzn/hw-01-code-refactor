# Code Refactor For Horiseon

This project is a code refactor of a website by Horiseon. The company wanted their website code to meet accessibilty standards. This was achieved by replacing ```<div>``` tags with other semantic elements such as ```<section>``` and ```<aside>```.

In addition the css and html were cleaned up to provide more clarity and longevity to the source code. The page was titled *"Online Tools For Businesses | Horiseon"* to make the page optimal for search engines.
